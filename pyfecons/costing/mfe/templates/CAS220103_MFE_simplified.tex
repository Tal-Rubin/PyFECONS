\subsubsection*{Cost Category 22.01.03: Coils}

This cost category includes the costing for the plasma confinement coils using a simplified conductor scaling model. The total magnet system cost is estimated from the required conductor quantity (in kilo-ampere-meters) and a confinement-type-dependent manufacturing markup.\\

\subsubsection*{Scaling Model}

The total conductor quantity is computed from the peak magnetic field and coil bore radius using an empirical total-system scaling law:

\[
\text{total\_kAm} = G \times \frac{B_{\max} \times R_{\text{coil}}^2}{\mu_0 \times 1000}
\]

where $G$ is a geometry factor that depends on the confinement type. For tokamaks ($G = 4\pi^2$), this captures the total conductor for TF + CS + PF coils combined. For magnetic mirrors ($G = n_{\text{coils}} \times 4\pi$), each solenoid coil independently produces the field. For stellarators ($G = 4\pi^2 \times f_{\text{path}}$), the cooperative field is similar to tokamaks but the complex 3D coil paths require additional conductor.\\

The coil bore radius $R_{\text{coil}}$ encompasses the plasma, vacuum vessel, blanket, and shield. For aneutronic fuels without a breeding blanket, the coils can be placed closer to the plasma, resulting in a smaller $R_{\text{coil}}$ and correspondingly cheaper magnets.\\

The total cost is then:

\[
C_{22.01.03} = \text{total\_kAm} \times \text{cost\_per\_kAm} \times \text{markup}
\]
