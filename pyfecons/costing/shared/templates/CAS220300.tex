\subsubsection{Cost Category 22.03: Auxiliary Cooling Systems}

The Cost Category 22.03 covers auxiliary cooling and cryogenic equipment. It has been recommended that all cooling services be directly associated with the specific account requiring those services. Auxiliary Cooling Systems consists of:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Cost Category 22.03.01 Auxiliary Cooling Systems: cooling services for reactor auxiliaries, scaled with thermal power (\$ C220301 M).
    \item Cost Category 22.03.02 Cryoplant Equipment: compressors, liquefiers, cold-box, distribution piping, and purification systems for cryogenic cooling of magnets and other cold components. Scaled from ITER cryoplant reference (\$ C220302 M).
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Cost Category 22.03.04.01 Refrigeration
        \item Cost Category 22.03.04.02 Piping
        \item Cost Category 22.03.04.03 Fluid Circulation Driving System
        \item Cost Category 22.03.04.04 Tanks
        \item Cost Category 22.03.04.05 Purification
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

The total for auxiliary cooling systems is \$ C220300 M.
